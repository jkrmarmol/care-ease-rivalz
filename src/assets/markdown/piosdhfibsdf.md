## Cause of Your Pain

Based on the symptoms you've described, we can identify potential causes:

- **Musculoskeletal Issues:**
  - A dull ache in the lower back and hips, especially with a history of a slipped disc, suggests musculoskeletal problems, possibly chronic lower back pain or sciatica.

- **Lifestyle Factors:**
  - A sedentary job and being overweight contribute significantly to back pain. Prolonged sitting can exacerbate these issues, leading to stiffness and increased pain.

- **Possible Recurrence:**
  - Given your history of a slipped disc, there might be a recurrence or related spinal problems causing these symptoms.

## Tips and Suggestions for Treatment

1. **Ergonomic Improvements:**
   - Adjust your sitting position and workstation to maintain proper posture and reduce strain on your back.

2. **Weight Management:**
   - Work towards a healthier weight to decrease the burden on your back and improve overall health.

3. **Physical Therapy:**
   - Engage in physical therapy to strengthen back muscles and improve flexibility.

4. **Regular Movement and Exercise:**
   - Incorporate regular breaks from sitting and include exercises like walking or swimming to keep your back active and flexible.

5. **Heat Therapy:**
   - Continue using heat pads for temporary relief, as they can help relax muscles and alleviate pain.

6. **Pain Medication:**
   - Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can be used, but consult a doctor for chronic pain management.

7. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - Implement lifestyle changes to include regular exercise and a balanced diet.
