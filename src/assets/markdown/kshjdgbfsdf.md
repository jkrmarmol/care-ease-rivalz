## Cause of Your Pain

Based on the symptoms you've described, we can identify potential causes:

- **Cardiac Concerns:**
  - Chest pain radiating to your left arm, especially with a smoking history, suggests possible cardiac issues like angina or a heart attack.

- **Neurological Factors:**
  - Sharp, shooting pain down your leg and tingling/numbness in your fingers may indicate nerve compression or irritation, such as sciatica or carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Gastrointestinal Issues:**
  - Abdominal pain worsening after eating could be due to conditions like gastritis, an ulcer, or gallbladder problems.

- **Lifestyle Contributions:**
  - A sedentary lifestyle and long work hours may exacerbate neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms.

## Tips and Suggestions for Treatment
