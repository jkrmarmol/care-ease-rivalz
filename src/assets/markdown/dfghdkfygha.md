## Cause of Your Headaches

Based on the symptoms you've described, we can identify potential causes:

- **Migraine Variations:**
  - Given your history and the location, quality, and associated symptoms of your headaches, these could be a variation of migraines, potentially exacerbated by stress and screen time.

- **Tension Headaches:**
  - The throbbing pain in the temples and behind the eyes, aggravated in the mid-afternoon, suggests tension headaches, possibly related to eye strain and stress.

- **Lifestyle Factors:**
  - Prolonged screen time, irregular sleep patterns, and high stress levels are significant contributors to these headache patterns.

## Tips and Suggestions for Treatment

1. **Screen Time Management:**
   - Take regular breaks from screens. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.

2. **Stress Management:**
   - Incorporate relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga into your daily routine.

3. **Regular Sleep Schedule:**
   - Establish a consistent sleep schedule to improve sleep quality and potentially reduce headache frequency.

4. **Ergonomic Workspace:**
   - Adjust your workspace for better ergonomics, reducing strain on your neck and eyes.

5. **Hydration and Diet:**
   - Maintain adequate hydration and a balanced diet. Sometimes dehydration or certain foods can trigger headaches.

6. **Medication Review:**
   - Since over-the-counter painkillers provide limited relief, consider consulting a doctor for a review of your medication.

7. **Professional Consultation:**
   - If these headaches continue or worsen, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation.

## Specialist Consultations

- **Neurologist:** To assess the headaches more comprehensively, especially considering your migraine history.
- **Ophthalmologist:** To check for any vision-related issues contributing to your headaches.
- **Psychologist or Counselor:** For stress management strategies and techniques.
